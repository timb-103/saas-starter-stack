This guide is aimed at guiding you through the whole journey of building your own startup based on my learnings of growing my own startup Pallyy.

At the time of writing this I've been working on [Pallyy](https://pallyy.com) for almost 4 and a half years, growing it to around $75K MRR (monthly recurring revenue).

During these 4 years I've worked so much that it's actually quite hard to think back to the start, as I never imagined I'd still be working on it today but nevertheless I'll still give it a crack.

Building and growing a startup isn't easy, but it's not "hard" either. It takes time, and a lot of work. If you're willing to do these things then there's no reason you can't do it.

Before joining the startup world, I was a locksmith. A far cry from what I'm doing now. I also dropped out of school. The reason I'm mentioning these is that it doesn't matter where you are, or what you're doing, if you actually want a change then there's close to no reason you can't - because I did.

ps. I'm not a writer, and don't the best vocabulary so apologies if there's too many typos or exclamation marks or hypens - where they're not needed!!
