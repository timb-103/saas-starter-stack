# Your Startup Name

## 1. What's your startups name, what does it do, how long have you been working on it and (optional) your MRR?

Userdesk.io is an AI Chatbot platform for businesses.

It helps with reducing the customer support effort, collecting leads on auto-pilot from your landing page, and verify your knowledge base in minutes.

I launched Userdesk.io in June 2023 and the current MRR is $1.1k.

## 2. What's your name and what were you doing before?

I am Luca Restagno, I am a senior software engineer, but in 2019 I started working on my side products.

I've launched 6 SaaS products so far, and sold 3 of them.

Currently Userdesk.io is my main SaaS product, while my secondary product is Shipped.club, a SaaS Starter Kit.

## 3. How did you come up with your startup and it's name?

Userdesk was initially called Notionbase.

I wanted to create an AI Chatbot platform for Notion users, to diversify from the other AI Chatbot products.

Later on, I discovered that the term Notion is trademarked, therefore I renamed it to Userdesk.

## 4. Are you a programmer, if so, how did you learn and how long did it take?

Yes, I am a programmer. I've been a software engineer for the last 10 years, more or less.

I learned to code at the university, it was just the basics of PHP, CSS, MySQL.

I loved it and I started coding at home for personal projects, and I made it my profession.

## 5. How long did it take you to build a mvp, did you do any validation?

Right now, with my Shipped.club SaaS Starter kit, it takes less than 24 hours to launch a new product.

I recently launched indiehackernews.com with it, it took 6 hours in total.

Yes I do validation, and I use different techniques according to the type of product.

I did two pre-sales that worked great, I proposed a lifetime deal to get access to the product when ready.

Both times I got ~20 licenses sold, and I decided to continue with the product.

## 6. What was your launch like, what did you do, was it a success?

I did a pre-sale for Userdesk in June, I have sold 20 licenses in 24 hours with one single tweet.

I considered it a success and I completed the MVP then.

## 7. How long did it take to get your first customer?

If we consider the LTDs, it took less then 24 hours.

If we consider the first customer as the first recurrent paying customer, it took from two to three weeks.

## 8. What's your top marketing methods and how can others start doing them?

My top marketing channel is Twitter, even tho I wouldn't recommend it because it takes so long and so much consistency to create an audience. And to leverage it 100% you need to ship products that fit with your audience, otherwise it doesn't work.

I'm working much more on SEO right now, with free tools and content marketing, and the traffic is slowly increasing.

What worked great in the beginning, was to submit the product to as many AI product directories as possible. It gave an initial boost to the brand, and I got the first customers from there.

In June 2023 AI was very hyped.

## 9. Whats the top 5 tools you use to run your startup?

Next.js and React to build the product at lightning speed (using Shipped.club).

PostHog is now my favorite product analytics tool.

Loops is my favorite email platform for SaaS, both for transactional and marketing emails.

ChakraUI is the best UI Kit for React (and Vue).

Lemon Squeezy is my favorite choice to collect payments and manage taxation on sales (it's a Merchant of Record).

## 10. What would you do differently if starting over?

I would pick a product that's a better fit for my community on X, which is made of startup founders and indie makers.

And I would start working on SEO early on, with blog posts and free tools interesting for the target audience of the product.
