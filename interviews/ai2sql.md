# AI2sql

## 1. What's your startups name, what does it do, how long have you been working on it and (optional) your MRR?
My startup's name is [AI2sql](ai2sql.io). It is an AI-powered tool that can generate SQL queries based on natural language inputs. We have been working on it for the past three years and currently have an MRR of $5,600.

## 2. What's your name and what were you doing before?
My name is [Mustafa Ergisi](https://twitter.com/mustafaergisi). Before starting AI2sql, I was working as a BI and DWH consultant.

## 3. How did you come up with your startup and it's name?
As a consultant, I have observed that many non-technical users face difficulties while writing SQL queries. To address this issue, I have developed a tool that automates the process of generating SQL queries using AI. This tool is called AI2SQL, and its name reflects the fact that it uses Artificial Intelligence to simplify the SQL query writing process.

## 4. Are you a programmer, if so, how did you learn and how long did it take?
Yes, I am a programmer and consultant. I learned programming in college and have been working as a software developer and consultant for over 15 years.

## 5. How long did it take you to build a mvp, did you do any validation?
I was able to create an MVP in just a week. I posted a tweet about our idea and received validation from potential users. Additionally, Greg Brockman, the CTO of OpenAI, reposted [my Tweet](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1433065012675813378?s=46&t=CmqQWTSLR1_F6r0JIl_b7g) about AI2sql on Twitter, which helped me get more visibility for my project.

## 6. What was your launch like, what did you do, was it a success?
I also launched our product on Product Hunt and started building our presence on X(Twitter) with a "build in public" approach. These efforts helped us increase our visibility and reach a wider audience. Additionally, we continued to offer a free trial to users which further boosted our user acquisition.

## 7. How long did it take to get your first customer?
We got our first customer within a month of launching.

## 8. What's your top marketing methods and how can others start doing them?
Our top marketing methods are content marketing, social media, SEO, X (Twitter), and build-in-public. To start, create high-quality content, build a strong social media presence, optimize your website for search engines, use X to engage with your audience, and showcase your work through build-in-public approach to attract new customers.

## 9. Whats the top 5 tools you use to run your startup?
Our top 5 tools are OpenAI, Bubble, Stripe, Softr, and Slack.

## 10. What would you do differently if starting over?
If starting over, we would focus more on building a community around our product and getting user feedback earlier in the development process.
