# Interview Guidelines

Your interview is going to be read by people very early in their startup life so please explain things in detail (but not too much detail, we want it to be easily digestable). It's the same 10 questions for all interviews.

**Be honest, and transparent. No BS.**

You must have at least $500 MRR to submit a interview. Interviews may or may not go live depending on the quality, so be sure to fix typos etc.

## Submitting

To submit your interview just follow the steps below. 

1. copy the [example.md](https://github.com/timb-103/saas-starter-stack/blob/main/interviews/1.example.md)
2. rename it to your startups name eg. pallyy.md
3. add your answers and [open a pull request](https://github.com/timb-103/saas-starter-stack/pulls)

[Here's the example you can use](/interviews/example).

Alternatively you can leave your interview in a [new discussion](https://github.com/timb-103/saas-starter-stack/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell) and we'll format it for you.

Interviews will be ordered by their submission date.
