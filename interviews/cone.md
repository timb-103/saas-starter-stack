# Cone

## 1. What's your startups name, what does it do, how long have you been working on it and (optional) your MRR?
My startup is called [Cone](https://cone.app), a color picker tool that includes Pantone matching and it helps users in accurately identifying colors. My current MRR stands at $1300.

## 2. What's your name and what were you doing before?
Iâ€™m Kushagra Agarwal. Before founding Cone, I worked as a designer at a startup. Cone initially started as a side project, so I dedicated only my weekends and free time to it.

## 3. How did you come up with your startup and it's name?
Being colorblind, I needed an app that could identify the colors of objects around me, which led to the creation of Cone. The name "Cone" comes from the Cone cells in our eyes which are used to perceive colors :)

## 4. Are you a programmer, if so, how did you learn and how long did it take?
Yes, I am. I had a very basic knowledge of JavaScript when I started. For Cone, I learnt Objective-C and later Swift by myself. This was more of an ongoing thing as I kept learning while building and eventually my hourly round trips to StackOverflow reduced.

## 5. How long did it take you to build a mvp, did you do any validation?
It took me about a month to build the MVP. I did my validation through Reddit's colorblind community and it was a great source of early feedback for me. 

## 6. What was your launch like, what did you do, was it a success?
The launch started off slowly. Initially, Cone was a very niche product built specifically for the colorblind, but it eventually evolved into a tool useful for designers in general, after which it started gaining some traction. I also casually posted about it on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14254357) one day and it shot up to the front page!

## 7. How long did it take to get your first customer?
Cone was originally a paid app with a "pay once, use forever" model, and I got my first few customers from r/colorblind on Reddit.

## 8. What's your top marketing methods and how can others start doing them?
Currently my top marketing tool is search ads + shameless self promotion whenever I get a chance. 

For search ads, I think the biggest challenge is finding keywords with good popularity and less competition. I was lucky to have started Cone as a niche product so naturally the competition was lesser and the CPC turned out to be very low. 

## 9. Whats the top 5 tools you use to run your startup?
- RevenueCat, for subscription management within the app.
- Segment and Mixpanel, for validating new features and understand user behavior
- Xcode for coding + testing the app
- RealmDB for making it easy to work with data on device
- Cloudkit for syncing the data across devices

## 10. What would you do differently if starting over?
I would make the app free with subscriptions from the start. I moved to a subscription based model 7-8 months ago and have seen a massive growth. From doing $400-$500 monthly revenue, to now touching $3000 every month.
