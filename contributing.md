# Contribution Guidelines

To add a tool to the list, please [create a pull request](https://github.com/timb-103/saas-starter-stack/pulls) or [open a issue](https://github.com/timb-103/saas-starter-stack/issues) adhering to the following guidelines:

- Look at the `items/example.md` file for an example of how to format your submission.
- Create a `your-tool-name.md` file in the `items/tools` directory.
- New categories are welcome, but please also add it to the `partials/sections.md` file.
- Category on both your tool and the `partials/sections.md` file should be matching.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.

Thank you for your suggestions!
